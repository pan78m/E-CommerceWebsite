## Overview

The online shopping database project is an initiative to create a user-friendly e-commerce platform. It encompasses database design using SQL, secure login and sign-up inter- faces, and an efficient admin panel, catering to user convenience, business expansion, data-driven insights, and technological advancements in the rapidly growing online shopping industry. The project aims to provide a seamless shopping experience while ensuring data security and facilitating effective platform management.

The online shopping database project encompasses key components, including a secure login interface, a user-friendly sign-up interface, and an efficient admin panel. These interfaces are pivotal in ensuring user authentication and data security, simplify- ing user registration, and enabling effective platform management.



## Goals/Objectives

The design goals and objectives for the online shopping database project encompass
various aspects, including database design, user interfaces, and administrative functionalities. Here are some specific objectives along with descriptions for each topic:

- Database Design Using SQL:

  Objective: Design a robust and well-structured database using SQL to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve product information, customer data, and order details.

  Description: The database design is fundamental to the project’s success. By creating a clear, normalized, and efficient database schema, the project ensures that data integrity is maintained, and the system operates smoothly. SQL will be utilized to define tables, relationships, indexes, and constraints to optimize data storage and retrieval.

- User Login Interface:

  Objective: Develop a secure and user-friendly login interface to allow customers to authenticate themselves before accessing the platform.

 Description: The login interface is a critical component for user authentication
  and data security. It should provide a simple yet secure mechanism for users to
  log in, protecting their personal information. It will include features like username/password validation, password encryption, and potentially two-factor authentication for enhanced security.


- User Signup Interface:

  Objective: Createanintuitiveanduser-friendlysignupinterfacethatenablesnew customers to register on the platform.

  Description: The signup interface plays a pivotal role in expanding the user base. It should guide users through the registration process, collecting essential infor- mation and verifying email addresses. Security measures, such as CAPTCHA, may be incorporated to prevent automated bot registrations.

- Admin Panel Interface:

  Objective: Develop a feature-rich admin panel interface that empowers adminis- trators to manage products, monitor orders, and oversee user activities.

  Description: The admin panel interface is designed for internal stakeholders to manage the platform efficiently. It should provide tools for adding, editing, and removing products, monitoring order processing, and accessing user data. Ad- vanced functionalities might include analytics, reporting, and user management.

  These objectives represent the foundation of the project, encompassing the essen- tial components required to establish a successful online shopping platform. By focusing on database design, user interfaces, and administrative capabilities, the project aims to provide a comprehensive and secure shopping experience for both customers and platform administrators.

# Implementation

In the implementation phase of the Online BD ShopHouse project, the primary focus was on developing a robust and user-friendly application using PHP and MySQL. PHP served as the scripting language for server-side development, while MySQL was em- ployed as the relational database management system to store and manage the project’s data.

The implementation encompassed the creation of various modules and functionalities- ties, addressing both the admin and customer sections. The following key aspects were considered during the implementation process:

## Design User Panel
